# Optimal Transport in Generative Adversarial Networks
Optimal Transport Project

This project explores Optimal Transport variants in Generative Adversarial Network.
The goal is to implement recent GANs with enhanced loss function that builds on Optimal Transport Theory.

## Context

[Optimal Transport](https://marcocuturi.net/ot.html) course taught at ENSAE with [prof. Marco CUTURI.](https://marcocuturi.net/)

## Content

- Jupyter notebook `OT-GANs.ipynb` which is a step by step guide of the study on Sinkhorn divergence and OT-GANs.

- Jupyter notebook `W-GANs.ipynb` which is a step by step guide of the study on Wasserstein distance and Wasserstein-GANs.

- The resulted plots are saved in `images`.

- The datasets are stored in `data`.
